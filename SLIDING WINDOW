PS- 713. Subarray Product Less Than K
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays 
where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

/* CODE */
/* SLIDING WINDOW O(n) */
class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k){
        if(k<=1) return 0;  //no such subarray will exist
        int i=0, j=0;
        int ans=0;
        int prod=1;
        while(j<nums.length){
            prod*=nums[j];
            while(i<nums.length && prod>=k){
                prod/=nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            ans+=j-i+1; //no of subarrays ending at j
            j++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

/*
LOGIC---
All elements in array are greater than 0 -> +ve.
Hence we can directly proceed with multiplying forward.
And the moment it crosses k, we can divide it by the previous and multiply with the next and check again.

But what we need is number of subarrays.
So, we also need to have the start and end index of the window.
So, we maintain two pointers for it.
