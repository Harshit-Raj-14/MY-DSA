Properties of XOR:
a^a=0
a^0=a
(a+b) = (a^b) + 2*(a&b) [Used to solve sum vs XOR problem]



## Sum vs XOR ##
Given an integer n, find each x such that: 0<=x<=n & x+n==x^n. Return the number of x's satisfying the criteria.
BRUTE FORCE: O(n) FAILS=> TLE
Optimised Approach:
Just understand the property of xor and addition in binary numbers. When you add two bits, it increases decimal value anyhow.....
but if you take xor of two bit, it can decrease or increase both.....can decrease only when both bit are 1.
So if you put 1 anywhere where there is already 1 in number then it will make 0 at that position and decrease the value....but on the other side in addition, value will be getting increased anyhow
So basically, try to observe and you will find that by placing 1 only on 0 bit position, the difference in both side are equal.
the answer is 2^(no. of 0 bits in binary form of n)

LOGIC---(a+b) = (a^b) + 2*(a&b)
that means, if(a&b)==0, then we have : (a+b)=a^b=>{half adder implementation}
Now, our problem reduces to findign count of all possible values of 0<=x<=n such that n&x=0.
To find count of such painrs => we need to unset all set bits of n.
If the kth bit is set at a particular position in n, kth bit in x must be 0 always, else kth bit of x can be 0 or 1.
Now its permutation and combination.
Let's say our n is-> 0110111000
So, all we need to make x something like => _00_ _000_ _ _
And now to fill the boxes we have two chocies that is 0 or 1. => 2 chocies
So, total permutations of x can be => 2^(32-count of set bits in n) => becuase only at (32-count of set bits in x) will be the place where we ahve the chocie otherwise we can only put 0.
SOLUTION : In a way, ans=2^(unset bits in n)

Approach : find no of unset bits. then 2^unsetbits)

CODE:
    public static long sumXor(long n) {
        int unsetbits=0;
        while(n>0){
            if((n&1)==0) unsetbits++;
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return (long)Math.pow(2,unsetbits);  //return 1<<unsetbits
    }

Note : Math.pow() is double so typecast to int.
TC-O(logn)



## Find two numbers from their sum and XOR ##
Given the sum and xor of two numbers X and Y s.t. sum and xor lies in [0, 2^{64}-1] , we need to find the numbers minimizing the value of X.
Input : Sum = 17, Xor = 13
Output : a = 2, b = 15

SOLUTION 1:
A simple solution is to generate all possible pairs with given XOR. To generate all pairs, we can follow below rules. Let's cosndier the bits at position i and generalise:
If XOR[i]=1, then both a[i] and b[i] will be different.
If XOR[i]=0, then both a[i] and b[i] will be same.
We also know that SUM always increases when we add, but in XOR we might get a 0 when 1^1.
If XOR[i] = 0 and SUM[i] = 0, then a[i] = b[i] = 0. Only one possibility for this bit.
If XOR[i] = 0 and SUM[i] = 1, then a[i] = b[i] = 1. Only one possibility for this bit.
If XOR[i] = 1 and SUM[i] = 0, then (a[i] = 1 and b[i] = 0) or (a[i] = 0 and b[i] = 1), we can pick any of the two.
If XOR[i] = 1 and SUM[i] = 1, result not possible (Note XOR[i] = 1 means different bits)

SOLUTIO 2:
A nice property of both xor and addition is that they are commutative. That menas if we swap the set bits of a with corresponding unset bits of Y, we would minmise X.
At the same time the value of SUM and XOR remains unchanged.
Example:
a=0111 =7
b=1010 = 10
Currently, SUM=17 and XOR=13

Now, swap set bits of x with corresponding unset bits of y 
a=0010 = 2 => minimised
b=1111 = 15
SUM=17 and XOR=13
Now we know that;
x+y=SUM
y=XOR^x
We can derive, x=(sum-xor)/2

Pseudo code:
if(SUM<XOR) return false;   //no solution
else{
    int x=(SUM-XOR)/2;
    int y=SUM-x;
}
