952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor - A directed graph problem involving DSU.

LC 239. Sliding Window Maximum - A hashing problem with an alternative solution using deque.

LC 11. Container With Most Water medium two-pointers based problem 

A binary-tree postorder problem. 
Medium difficulty, with a hard space optimization.
- Optimized space from O(logn) -> O(1) using Morris. This round went well.
If you know Morris Traversal, you can solve this as well.
