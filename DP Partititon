Partition Pattern :
Whenever we need to find the answer to a large problem such that the problem can be broken into subproblems and the
final answer varies due to the order in which the subproblems are solved, we can think in terms of partition DP.

PS- 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
Return the minimum total cost of the cuts on rod, if you can reorder the cuts array the way you want. 
After each cut the cost of length is added to cuts.

TC- O(m^3)
Why O(m^3) = The number of states in our DP is the number of possible combinations of (left, right), which is O(m^2). 
For each subproblem cost(left, right), we need to try all possible cutting positions between new_cuts[left] and new_cuts[right], 
resulting in an additional factor of m. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m^3).

/*
LOGIC---
We need to reorder the cuts in such a way that total cost is minimum. 

ALGORITHM:
Whenever you make a cut in cuts array : {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}
And make cut at a3.
It will divide stick in two parts.
Now {a1, a2} will operate on left part of stick. and {a4,a5} will operate on right part of stick.
We want such configuration to make things simple. And a3 will go away.
So, first of all array of cuts should be sorted for this to happen for left and right calculation to be correct. 
For a1 and a2 to fall on left stick and a4 and a5 to fall on right part of stick subproblems.

Add 0 and n to our cuts list. Why? for correct size cost calculation. 
Think of it like intiating the process with cuts at 0 or nth position which will give the full rod itself.

So, cuts = {0, a1,a2,a3,a4,a5, n} => sorted
Now apply cut at a3 position.
Cuts : {0,a1,a2} {a4,a5,n}
Rods : [0.1.2.....a2...a3] [a3....a4....a5....n] => this will be the left and right of rods now
initial rod length = end-start = n-0 = n
left rod length = end-start = a3-0 = where cut made - 0
right rod length = end-start = n-a3 = n - where cut made

expression = cost of cutting the current rod + solving left subproblem rod + solving right subproblem rod
expression = arr[j+1]-arr[i-1] + solve(i, idx-1) + solve(idx+1, j) where idx was the place where cut was made
For first cut = arr[cuts.size()-2 + 1] - arr[1-1] + solve(1,idx-1) + solve(idx+1, cuts.size()-2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARTITION DP:
Whenever we make a cut, we are changing the length of the stick which in turn decides the cost. 
Therefore the order in which we make the cuts changes the total cost. whenever the order of solving the problem comes into play, 
we can think in terms of Partition DP.

Algo of partition dp: 
    Start with the entire block/array and mark it with i,j.
    Try all partitions.
    Return the best possible answer of the two partitions (the answer that comes after dividing the problem into two subproblems and solving them recursively).


APPROACH---
Step 1: 
If we have to make a total of cn (cn=cuts.length) cuts, then we need to decide which is the first cut out of those cn. Brute force can be to make every cut as the first cut and go further.

Step 2: So, for every 0≤i<cn, make cuts[i] as the first cut. Cost for this will be n (stick length).
Now we will have two sticks of lengths (cuts[i]−0) and (n−cuts[i]).

Step 3: Now, to make the second cut, we can choose any one of the two sticks because their cost will be dependent on only their length. It is the same problem but with smaller stick length. And we have to reorder all the cuts that are to be made on first smaller stick (0...cuts[i]). And similarly reorder the cuts for the second smaller stick (cuts[i]...n).

If we select cuts[p1] as the first cutting position, it would result in a cost of n and split the stick into two pieces of length cuts[p1] and n - cuts[p1], respectively.

Understanding the DP expression:

Note:  We are breaking the left subproblem to f(i,ind-1) rather than f(i,ind) because we have already made a cut at CUTS[ind] and we don't want to consider it twice.

PS- Matrix Chain Multiplication
Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. 
The efficient way is the one that involves the least number of multiplications. 

Input: N = 5, arr = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}
Output: 26000
Explanation: There are 4 matrices of dimension 40x20, 20x30, 30x10, 10x30. 
Say the matrices are named as A, B, C, D. Out of all possible combinations, the most efficient way is (A*(B*C))*D. 
The number of operations are - 20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30 = 26000.

For a matrix[mxn]x[pxq] => for matrix multiplication : n==p

New matrix will be of size: [mxq]

ABCD => A(BCD), (AB)(CD), (ABC)(D)
A(BCD) => A(((B)(CD)), A((BC)(D))

So, we need to apply partititon dp, becuase answer changes if we change the palce where we partiition, 
basically the sequence.

If range fo multiplication is from l to r:
min(l) = 0
max(r) = n-1

Then at i
no of mult = arr[i-1]*arr[i]*arr[i-1]
left partition = solve(arr, l, i)
right partition = solve(arr, i+1, r)

Note : now becuase in mult we have arr[i-1]. 
we would want the array traversal start from index 1 => l=1

Number of multiplications on a range:
For a matrix chain A1, A2, ..., An, the dimensions are stored as arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n]. 
The formula should multiply the dimensions arr[l-1] * arr[i] * arr[r], 
as these represent the dimensions of the matrices involved in the multiplication.

PS- 312. Burst Balloons
If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins.

/*
LOGIC---
Same as minimum cut on sticks

Why not arr[i-1]*arr[i]*arr[i+1] but, arr[l-1]*arr[i]*arr[r+1]?
The array is being divided recursively into smaller subarrays, and at each step, you are bursting one balloon in that range. 
The effective left and right boundaries are l-1 and r+1, which refer to the balloons that would be next to balloon i after all the other balloons between l and r are burst.
=> i-1 and i+1 are misleading: In a recursive approach, i-1 and i+1 may no longer be the adjacent balloons because balloons between l and i-1 or i+1 and r could have already been burst.
=> arr[l-1] * arr[i] * arr[r+1] ensures that you are considering the correct left and right boundaries in the context of the remaining balloons after bursting some of them.

If your array is [3, 1, 5, 8], and you're bursting the 2nd balloon (value 5), the current boundaries might be different after recursive calls, and the actual neighbors are the ones outside the current subproblem (e.g., arr[l-1] and arr[r+1]).
