Note: If in a question when you want to repeatedly apply operation on the smallest elemnt of an array. 
But its value changes such that the smallest element in array keeps on changing and it can be anywhere.
Use priority queue to keep the min lement on top. And as soon as operation is applied. 
The priority queue will reexamine for the correct min element.

eg: For array [2,4,5,6] find smallest element if the min element of the array is doubled every k times.
while (k-- > 0) {
   long minElement = pq.poll(); // Get and remove the smallest element
    minElement = (2 * minElement); // Double it 
    pq.add(minElement); // Insert back into the priority queue
}
