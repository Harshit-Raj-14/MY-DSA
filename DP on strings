PS- 139. Word Break
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated 
sequence of one or more dictionary words. Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".

/* CODE */
/* DP O(n^2) */
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict){
        HashSet<String> dict = new HashSet<>(wordDict); //convert dict to hashset -> using HashSet for O(1) lookups
        Boolean[] memo = new Boolean[s.length()]; // Memoization array
        return solve(s, dict, 0, memo);
    }

    public static boolean solve(String s, HashSet<String> dict, int start, Boolean[] memo){
        if(start==s.length()) return true;
        if(memo[start]!=null) return memo[start];
        for(int end=start+1;end<=s.length();end++){
            String substring  =s.substring(start, end);
            if(dict.contains(substring) && solve(s,dict,end, memo)) return memo[start]=true;
        }
        return memo[start]=false;
    }
}

/*
LOGIC---
Is there a combination of words in wordDict that can be used to recreate the original string s. 

Instead of seeing whether we can form word from dictionary words.
Make substring of s and check whether these substrigns exist in diction or not.
Convert dict to hahset for efficient lookups.

Time complexity: O(n⋅m⋅k)
There are n states of dp(i). Because of memoization, we only calculate each state once. 
To calculate a state, we iterate over m words, and for each word perform some substring operations which costs O(k). 
Therefore, calculating a state costs O(m⋅k), and we need to calculate O(n) states.

Space complexity: O(n)

PS- 2707. Extra Characters in a String
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. 
You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. 
There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.

/*
LOGIC---
Same logic as word break but this time just need to take elft character which will be equal to not_Take logic.

Time complexity: O(n^3). 
There can be N+1 unique states of the dp method. In each state of dp, we iterate over end, which is O(N) iterations. 
In each of these iterations, we create a substring, which costs O(N). 
Hence, the overall cost of the dp method is O(N3).

Space complexity: O(N+M⋅K)

        boolean ans=false;

            ans= ans || solve(s1,s2,s3,i+1,j); 
        }
        if(j<s2.length() && s2.charAt(j)==s3.charAt(i+j)){  //when char matches with s3 and s2 remains
            ans= ans || solve(s1,s2,s3,i,j+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

/*
LOGIC---
GOAL---
Interwaeave s1 and s2 to make s3 while making turns for s1 ans s2 to be a part of answer needs to be alternate.
TWO POINTER WILL FAIL. AND WHY DP?
This test case then tells you why this question is asking for a dp solution.
s1 = "aabc"
s2 = "abad"
s3= "aabadabc"

Now in this, if you start moving from the back using the 2 pointer approach, it keeps on eleminating the character from the 1st string i.e s1. But when s1 gets exhausted, your s3 does not match with s2.

IMPORTANT---Here you take a note that, when char at s1 and s2 are equal, we need to check if deleting the char from s1 is a correct move or deleting the char from s2 would be a correct move.

INTUITION---That clearly means, we have 2 choices here, either to delete the char from s1 or s2.

Now for a bigger testcase like this it is clearly evident that the que is asking for a Dyanmic Programming solution!!

s1 = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
s2 = "aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
s3 = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

So, think of it as two chocies when interleaving which character to choose from s1 or s2.
If s1 and s2 are equal to s3[i], we have a choice,
otherwsie choose it from the string in which it is available.


REDUCE 3D TO 2D DP---
You might be tempted to use i, j and k to keep track of s1, s2 and s3 respectively in your recursive calls but it gave me TLE. (Please note that it is not wrong)
The trick here was to remove k from your changing state and reduce dp from 3D to 2D.
=> The thing here is, at every step k is nothing but i+j, so we dont need to keep track of k because we can get it from i and j.

APPROACH---
So the trick here is to how to implement this alternate selection of substrings. I am pretty much sure you have concluded that we need recursion to solve this, but how to ensure that when we append the string, it is the way it's mentioned.

What you need to do it, instead of appending substrings, append character of strings. At each iteration, check if s1[i] == s3[i+j] and below that check s2[j] == s3[i+j].
On satisfaction , call again the function with incremented i or j.
This way, if you observe, you will have implemented the above condition of alternating substrings.
