PS- 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

/* CODE */

/* USING HASHSET O(n), O(n) */
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) set.add(nums[i]);
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            int curr=nums[i];
            if(!set.contains(curr-1)){
                int count=1;
                while(set.contains(curr+count)) count++;
                ans = Math.max(ans, count);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

/*
Why hashset?
The equal elements were causing us a problem.
Hashset quickly allow us to access element so it will help us to tell whetehr there is a consecutive elent or not.

Once put everything in hahset.
We start iterating from first element and think to check whether next consecutive exist or not in hahsset. But that sounds just like bruteforce. Checking from every element.

Trick: Instead of looking for next consecutive we try looking whether our curr is the start of a consecutive series or not. So, we look backward till we find the start.

And from there we start looking in front.

So, when we encounter a mid elemnt of a consecutive series, we don't reiterate till we say its start of a consecutive series.

/* USING SORTING O(nlogn) */
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if(n==0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int cnt = 1;
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue;   //don't forget this step to skip consecutive term
            if (nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1) cnt++;
            else{
                max = Math.max(max, cnt);
                cnt = 1;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(max, cnt);
    }
}

/*
LOGIC---
Why skip consecutive terms?
Input: nums =[1,2,0,1]
got Output: 2
Expected output: 3
