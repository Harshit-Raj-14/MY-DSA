* HashSet is very similar to that of unordered_set in C++. It implements set interface which ensures no duplicate elements are present in hashset. The insertion of an object in hashset is based on its hash value, therefore when you iterate over hashset the order of elements that you'll get will most probably be different than how they were entered in the hashset. Hash value is the unique value of an object generated by a hash function to uniquely identify an object.

* HashSet<Integer> set : Average time complexity for add, remove and look-up operation of HashSet is O(1). Worst case time complexity is O(N) which rarely occurs.

* TreeSet<Integer> set : On an average , each operation like insert, find and delete takes O(logn) time on average. Worst Case will also take O(logN) time for each operation. Thats the advantage of using TreeSet over HashSet. All elements are stored in sorted order.


*  HashMap<Integer, String> map : Average time complexity is O(1) and worst case time complexity is O(n) => happens rarely. Similar to unordered_map in C++.
```HashMap<Integer, Integer> a = new HashMap<>();```


* The TreeMap in Java is a concrete implementation of the java.util.SortedMap interface. It provides an ordered collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are ordered based on their natural order or a custom Comparator passed to the constructor.
  The treemap implementation is not synchronized in the sense that if a map is accessed by multiple threads, concurrently and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally.
  A TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black tree, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. This provides efficient performance for common operations such as adding, removing, and retrieving elements, with an average time complexity of O(log n). Hnece it works better than hashmap which might have worst case O(n).
