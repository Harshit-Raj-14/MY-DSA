A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a set of conventions for building web services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.
Representational: This refers to how resources (like data or objects) are represented in the API. Each resource has a specific representation, often in formats like JSON or XML, which makes it understandable to both humans and machines.

State: This refers to the condition or data of the resource at a specific point in time. In a web context, it represents the current status or data of an application or resource.

Transfer: This indicates the process of moving data or information between the client (the user or application making the request) and the server (the system providing the resource). In REST, this transfer happens over the web using standard HTTP methods.

Summary

Together, Representational State Transfer describes a way to access and manipulate resources over the web by transferring their representations while maintaining the state of the resources.
